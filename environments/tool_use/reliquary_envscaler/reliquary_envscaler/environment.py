"""Episode environment over EnvScaler's programmatic tool worlds (MIT).

The upstream release carries each world as Python source and each scenario
as an initial state plus a task plus a checklist of terminal-state boolean
functions. This adapter presents that as a Reliquary episode: deterministic
from an index, replayable by the validator, graded on final state.

Three properties are load-bearing and each is pinned by a test:

* the execution namespace is frozen (``shims``), or replay diverges;
* the initial config is deep-copied per reset, or two rollouts of one prompt
  share mutable state;
* only checks that are *false* at the initial state count toward reward.
  Measured over 400 scenarios, 16.7% of checks are already true before the
  agent acts, so a raw pass rate pays a model that does nothing.

Vendored from reliquadotai/reliquary, `reliquary/environment/agentic/envs/envscaler_tools_v1/environment.py`,
with imports rewritten for this standalone package.
