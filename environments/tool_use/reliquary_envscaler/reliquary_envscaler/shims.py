"""Deterministic execution namespace for upstream environment classes.

The environment implementations are LLM-written Python carried as source in
the pinned dataset. Measured over the 191 published classes, 31% call
``time.time()``, 32% call ``datetime.now()`` and 20% use ``uuid``; only 36%
are free of all three. Executed as-is, a miner and a validator replaying the
same episode observe different bytes, and the honest miner is rejected.

Freezing those three recovers every environment: with the shims below all
191 instantiate and 300 sampled scenarios replay byte-identically across
independent runs.

The frozen values are therefore part of the consensus contract, not local
configuration. They live here so ``implementation_sha256`` binds them, and
the tests pin them.

Vendored from reliquadotai/reliquary, `reliquary/environment/agentic/envs/envscaler_tools_v1/shims.py`,
with imports rewritten for this standalone package.
