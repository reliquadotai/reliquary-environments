# Hook failure contract (implemented by reliquary_sandbox_service.episodes.grader):
#   OPEN_FAILED:  an exception from `prepare` fails the open. It is our side: no record 0 is
#                 written and the session token is burnt.
#   ABORTED:      (ours, void, the task may be re-run) only for infrastructure failures: a
#                 sandbox InfraFault seen at any point of `extract` or `grade` (even one the
#                 hook caught or re-raised as another exception), every pristine-box attempt
#                 failing to start, a failure of the sandbox's own code before the hook runs,
#                 and a hook calling a Runtime member the sandbox does not offer
#                 (prepare_uv_script, run_uv_script, open_process, run_background),
#                 and an EnvInfraError raised by `extract` or `grade` (the env saying the
#                 failure is its own or ours: logged at error level and counted per env as
#                 `env_infra_error`; in `grade` it is retried like an InfraFault).
#   BOX_FAILED:   the agent's box failed under `extract` because of what the agent did
#                 (BoxFault: it killed its processes, exhausted its pids, ...). Not paid.
#   GRADED 0.0:   everything else is the agent's outcome, graded 0.0 with a sandbox fact under
#                 the reserved "_grader" key: an exception raised by `extract` or `grade`
#                 itself (extract_failed / grading_failed: logged and counted per env, so fix
#                 real env bugs), a step past `grading_timeout_s` (extract_timeout /
#                 grading_timeout), output or state over its bound (state_too_large,
#                 grading_output_overflow), a non-regular file or a refused archive member
#                 (state_unreadable), a BoxFault in the pristine box (grading_box_failed),
#                 and a `grade` result that is not a GradeResult with a finite reward in
#                 [0, 1] and canonical-JSON facts without the "_grader" key
#                 (invalid_grade_result). Facts over 64 KiB canonical are replaced by
#                 {"facts_truncated": true, "_grader": {...}}.
#   Env code should still return agent-attributable outcomes rather than raise: `extract`
#   returns a sentinel and `grade` returns GradeResult(0.0, facts) saying why. Use
#   `runtime.archive` / `runtime.restore_archive` (the sandbox's busybox, vetted and rebuilt) to move
#   file trees, never the image's own tar, or anything run as root, on state the agent
#   controlled. The box's own tools as the box user are acceptable where grading bounds the
#   impact (SWE's extract runs the agent's git to take an untrusted diff, which grading
#   applies in a pristine box with path refusals).
#   Raise EnvInfraError ONLY from steps that run before any agent-controlled state is
#   applied in the box (e.g. preparing the pristine box: stripping history, setting hidden
#   tests aside), or for env-internal invariants (decoding the state our own `extract`
#   wrote, a grading step that must have run). Never for anything the agent's state can
#   cause: that is a graded 0, or the agent could void its own failing episodes.
